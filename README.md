# JavaSpring-SchedulerAPI

Welcome to the JavaSpring-SchedulerAPI project! This API is part of my college coursework on MicroService Applications. The goal of this project is to create a comprehensive scheduler for lectures, with the ability to manage teachers, subjects, student groups, classrooms, and scheduling terms. I've added a few personal touches to enhance its functionality.

## Features

- **Teacher Management:** Add, update, or remove teachers.
- **Subject Management:** Create, modify, or delete subjects.
- **Student Group Management:** Handle student groups with ease.
- **Classroom Management:** Add, edit, or remove classrooms.
- **Schedule Terms:** Schedule and manage lecture terms efficiently.
